# Motorcycle Parts Sales Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing sales data for a company that sells motorcycle parts. The goal is to calculate net revenue from wholesale orders, segmented by product line, month, and warehouse.

## Objectives
- Analyze sales data from three warehouses.
- Filter to include only wholesale orders.
- Calculate net revenue for each product line grouped by month and warehouse.

## Database Schema
The sales data includes the following columns:
- **order_number** (VARCHAR): Unique order number.
- **date** (DATE): Date of the order, from June to August 2021.
- **warehouse** (VARCHAR): The warehouse that the order was made from— North, Central, or West.
- **client_type** (VARCHAR): Whether the order was Retail or Wholesale.
- **product_line** (VARCHAR): Type of product ordered.
- **quantity** (INT): Number of products ordered.
- **unit_price** (FLOAT): Price per product (dollars).
- **total** (FLOAT): Total price of the order (dollars).
- **payment** (VARCHAR): Payment method—Credit card, Transfer, or Cash.
- **payment_fee** (FLOAT): Percentage of total charged as a result of the payment method.

## SQL Query
The main SQL query to calculate net revenue can be found in the `revenue_by_product_line.sql` file.

## Usage
To run this analysis:
1. Use a SQL client like PostgreSQL.
2. Import the dataset as `sales` table.
3. Execute the query in `revenue_by_product_line.sql` to replicate the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provides insights into the revenue generated by different product lines across various months and warehouses, helping the company understand their wholesale revenue streams better.
